With iDIN a merchant can identify the consumers name and address and verify if the age is 18+.

== Description ==

iDIN is a way to identify the customers data through a verification system, built by the Dutch banks. For more information about iDIN check [www.cm.nl/idin](https://www.cm.nl/idin).

The extension is designed for WordPress **WooCommerce** webshops. Customers can register and login to your webshop using iDIN. You can also configure age verification on all or specific products during checkout. After checking if the customers age is 18 years or older, the checkout will go to the next step in the process.

**You will need an separate account for subscription with CM** to connect your webshop iDIN, which you can obtain at [Create iDIN Account](https://idin.cmtelecom.com/merchant/register). CM is a third party that connects your WordPress webshop with the iDIN database and is one of the official Digital Identity Service Providers for iDIN in The Netherlands.

= Easy and safe =

To login or to identify someone using iDIN is very similar to the way Dutch consumers are using the most popular payment method iDEAL. In the merchant’s website, the user selects his own bank and gets redirected to the iDIN-screen of this bank. When the user logs in with his personal credentials, the bank will confirm his personal details safely to the merchant. Merchants won’t get any financial data from the user’s bank account such as balance or transactions. Right after the identification or login process, the connection between the bank and the merchant will be shutdown. So, the other way around, banks can’t get any information about the user like the visited pages or orders.

= Account registration with iDIN =

Offer your customers a safe registration progress by integrating iDIN in your webshop. This plugin creates accounts automatically, based on the iDIN powered information. This way you can be sure you have accurate customer details, any time. 

= Login with iDIN =

When your customer is registered with iDIN, you can offer them the possibility to login via their bank, just like they would with iDEAL. This is possible in the checkout of your webshop and in ‘my account’. This creates a fast and safe way of logging in, and will make your customer finish his order faster. 

= 18+ verification with iDIN =

Is a 18+ verification necessary for products you offer? With the iDIN / WordPress plugin you can obligate your customer to do so; the age of the customer will be verified by iDIN before the order can be completed. You can even relate 18+ verification to particular products, so your other products can be sold without age verification. 

= In need of support? =

This extension is established by collaboration of Pronamic and CM. Do you need any help during the installation or other challenges? Pronamic is WordPress specialist and will be pleased to help you.

= Need an iDIN licence? =

== Installation ==

= Automatic installation =

Automatic installation is the easiest option as WordPress handles the file transfers itself and you don’t need to leave your web browser. To do an automatic install of CM iDIN, log in to your WordPress dashboard, navigate to the Plugins menu and click Add New.

In the search field type “CM iDIN” and click Search Plugins. Once you’ve found our CM iDIN plugin you can view details about it such as the version number, rating and description. Most importantly of course, you can install it by simply clicking “Install Now”.

= Manual installation =

The manual installation method involves downloading our CM iDIN plugin and uploading it to your webserver via your favourite FTP application. The WordPress codex contains [instructions on how to do this here](http://codex.wordpress.org/Managing_Plugins#Manual_Plugin_Installation).

= Configuration =

After installation you can see CM iDIN in your settings menu. Go to “instellingen” or “configuration”. Fill in the Merchant token that you received from CM. After configuring the merchant token, it is automatically validated by CM.

In case you use Modus = Test and you’re performing iDIN transactions, you’ll receive dummy data to test with. 
With Modus = Live you’ll receive real consumer data as stored in the banks consumer database.

= Updating =

Automatic updates should work like a charm; as always though, ensure you backup your site just in case.
